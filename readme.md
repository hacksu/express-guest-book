# ExpressJS

Express is a framework for making super quick, easy, and high performing websites!

## Requirements

In order to use express, we need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and NPM installed. Head [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download NodeJS (and NPM, which is packaged in to the download)!

## Lets get started

Be sure to have NodeJS installed!

You can check to make sure everything is installed properly by running `node -v && npm -v` which should show two version numbers! If you're having problems, just Google `installing node [PLATFORM]`, like "installing node windows" and they should help you out. Google and StackOverflow is your friend!
